### **Files Overview**

#### **1. `Modelik_archi.py`**
- Contains a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for classifying types of columns.  
- Includes functionalities for **model training**, **evaluation**, **prediction**, and **saving** the trained model.  

#### **2. `Modelik.py`**
- Demonstrates the failure of a **linear model** on circular data distributions.  
- Implements a neural network that solves the problem effectively by handling non-linear patterns.

#### **3. `perceptronyPython.py`**
- Builds **perceptrons** for basic logical operations (e.g., AND, OR).  
- Implements a **multi-layer perceptron (MLP)** to solve the XOR problem, which single-layer perceptrons cannot handle.

#### **4. `p2.py`**
- Provides a deeper explanation of the XOR problem and its solution with perceptrons.
