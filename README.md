# (just a few) Neural Network Models and Perceptrons

This repository contains Python scripts showcasing various neural network models and perceptron implementations, each tackling specific tasks and illustrating key machine learning concepts.

### **Files Overview**

#### **1. `Modelik.py`**
- Demonstrates the failure of a **linear model** on circular data distributions.  
- Implements a neural network that solves the problem effectively by handling non-linear patterns.

#### **2. `perceptronyPython.py`**
- Builds **perceptrons** for basic logical operations (e.g., AND, OR).  
- Implements a **multi-layer perceptron (MLP)** to solve the XOR problem, which single-layer perceptrons cannot handle.

#### **3. `p2.py`**
- Provides a deeper explanation of the XOR problem and its solution with perceptrons.

#### **4. `QLearnTSP.py`**
- step by step analysis how Qlearning algorithm learns to solve TSP problem, with visualization!
